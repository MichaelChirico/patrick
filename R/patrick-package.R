#' Parameterized testing in R.
#'
#' `patrick` (parameterized testing in R is kind of cool!) is a `testthat`
#' extension that lets you create reusable blocks of a test codes. Parameterized
#' tests are often easier to read and more reliable, since they follow the DNRY
#' (do not repeate yourself) rule.
#'
#' This package is inspired by parameterized testing packages in other
#' languages, notably the
#' [`parameterized`](https://github.com/wolever/parameterized) library in
#' Python.
