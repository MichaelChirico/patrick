Author: Michael Quinn <msquinn@google.com>
Maintainer: Michael Quinn <msquinn@google.com>
Description: This is an extention of the testthat package that lets you add
  parameters to your test. Parameterized tests are often easier to read and
  more reliable, since they follow the DNRY (do not repeate yourself) rule.
