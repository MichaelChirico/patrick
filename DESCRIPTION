Author: Michael Quinn <msquinn@google.com>
Maintainer: Michael Quinn <msquinn@google.com>
Description: This is an extension of the 'testthat' package that lets you add
  parameters to your unit tests. Parameterized unit tests are often easier to
  read and more reliable, since they follow the DNRY (do not repeat yourself)
  rule.
